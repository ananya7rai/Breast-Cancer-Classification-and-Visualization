# Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-Visualization
This repository is based on fundamentals of machine learning to predict breast tumor diagnosis(malignant or benign) using SVM. It covers problem identification, exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, model building, evaluation, and optimization.

### Dataset Details ###
- We used the Breast Cancer (Wisconsin) Diagnosis dataset. It contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells and a set of 30 real-value features (from column 3-32) describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image of a of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

### Proposed Architecture ###
- Identifying the problem and getting the data
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Pre-processing the data
- Predictive Model using SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Optimizing the support vector classifier
