# Breast Cancer Classification and Visualization #
This repository is based on fundamentals of machine learning to predict breast tumor diagnosis(malignant or benign) using SVM. It covers problem identification, exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, model building, evaluation, and optimization.

## Dataset Details ##
We used the Breast Cancer (Wisconsin) Diagnosis dataset. It contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells and a set of 30 real-value features (from column 3-32) describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image of a of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Proposed Architecture ##
We'll first identify the problem and get the data for it. Then we'll perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and pre-process the data. After we have our data ready, we'll build a predictive model using Support Vector Machine(SVM) and optimize the support vector classifier according to our needs.

## Results ##
- We were successfully able to classfiy malignant and benign breast tumor using the SVM classifier.
- The SVM performs better when the dataset is standardized so that all attributes have a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of one.
- The 2 x 2 Confusion matrix shows the True Positive(TP), True Negative(TN), False Positive(FP) and False Negative(FN) count, giving a clear picture of the classifier's performance on each class.
- Successfully plotted decision boundaries for different classifiers- linear, polynomial and RBF.
